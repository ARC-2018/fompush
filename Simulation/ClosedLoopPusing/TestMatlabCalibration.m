% The procedure was repeated in the Matlab website, presumably to allow the
% usage of different checkerboards for intrinsic and extrinsic calibration
% or if the intrinsics are already known. We can ignore the previous lines
% if we use the ros calibration script for intrinsics, or we can remove
% this line if we use Matlab and the same board for intrinsic and extrinsic
